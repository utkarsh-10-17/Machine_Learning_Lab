# 🤖 ML Lab

Welcome to my **ML Lab**!  
This repository contains machine learning code, scripts, and notebooks I created while learning and experimenting with various ML concepts and algorithms.

## 📌 About

This repo is a personal learning playground where I explore:
- Classic ML algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, clustering, etc.)
- Data preprocessing and visualization techniques
- Model evaluation and tuning
- Small end-to-end ML projects and experiments

Everything here is meant for **education, practice, and sharing** with others who are also learning machine learning.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization with matplotlib / seaborn
- Supervised learning: regression & classification
- Unsupervised learning: clustering
- Model evaluation metrics
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch, etc.)
- Feature engineering basics
